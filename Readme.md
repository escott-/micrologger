# micrologger

meaningful application and request logs to be used with koa microservices

Support for rotating files or sending to a logging service with Ã˜MQ (more to come)

Add to your koa application:

```js
app.use(logger.request());
```

**Logging levels:**

DEBUG
INFO
ERROR


**Fields:**
**class** - class field represents the origin of the request. application, client\_request or service\_request

**host** - hostname

**pid** - process id

**severity** - logging level

**timestamp** - UTC epoch

**message** - log message with details about application, request, response or error

**path** - path of request

**method** - request method

**request\_id** - UID generated to track the individual request

**correlation\_id** - UID generated/forwarded through all services

**response\_time** - UTC epoch of response

**resolution\_time** - track the time for request to be resolved

**status** - status code

**metadata** - metadata specific to the request that was made. this can be specific event data that is helpful outside system logs 

The correlation id will be generated if the x-correlation-id is not found in the header. Services should pass this along in the header.

In development you get all the logs. Debug mode uses rotating files and will rotate files at 100K and keep 7 files. The files will be stored in the logs folder at the project root: /logs/out0.log, /logs/out1.log, /logs/out3.log, etc...

application logging in development uses debug. 

```sh
NODE_ENV=development node server
```

```js
const logger = require('micrologger');
proc.stdout.on('data', (data) => { 
  logger.app("info", data);
});
proc.stderr.on('data', (data) => { 
  logger.app("error", data);
});
```

Example of application debug in /logs/out.log

```json
{
  "class":"application",
  "host":"some-host",
  "pid":38131,
  "severity":"DEBUG",
  "timestamp":"2016-12-21T17:41:01.271Z",
  "message":"REST service listening on port: 1991"
}

```

Example of application error in /logs/out.log

```json
{
  "class":"application",
  "host":"some-host",
  "pid":40293,
  "severity":"ERROR",
  "timestamp":"2016-12-21T18:00:08.582Z",
  "message":"ReferenceError: thi is not defined at Object.module.exports.post ...rest of stack trace"
}
```

application logging with fluentd (more collectors to come)

if you're not in development you can add fluentd as the collector, logs will be sent to fluentd

```js
logger.collector('fluent', {
  host: CONFIG.internal.logging.fluent.host,
  port: CONFIG.internal.logging.fluent.port
});
```

request logging with koa:

```js
app.use(logger.request());
```

Request logging will log the request and response with the following...

Example of request logging (request)

```json
{
  "class":"client_request",
  "message":"GET /status",
  "host":"some-host",
  "path":"/status",
  "method":"GET",
  "request_id":"3eeb945c-f5b5-4431-a5fe-177dfae7fec5",
  "correlation_id":"d4cc5b41-c023-49bc-a55e-558093918de4",
  "request_time":"2016-12-21T21:05:57.620Z",
  "client":"client-ip",
  "pid":49078,
  "severity":"INFO"
}
```

Example of request logging (response)

```json
{
  "class":"client_request",
  "message":"Success - /status",
  "host":"some-host",
  "client":"client-ip",
  "path":"/status",
  "method":"GET",
  "request_id":"33931f5e-9915-466c-9d23-10977ab48da6",
  "correlation_id":"d4cc5b41-c023-49bc-a55e-558093918de4",
  "response_time":"2016-12-21T21:05:57.920Z",
  "resolution_time":"300ms",
  "status":200,
  "pid":49078,
  "metadata":{},
  "severity":"INFO"
}
```

request logging with fluentd (more collectors to come)

if you're not in development you can add fluentd as the collector, logs will be sent to fluentd

```js
logger.collector('fluent', {
  host: CONFIG.internal.logging.fluent.host,
  port: CONFIG.internal.logging.fluent.port
});
```
